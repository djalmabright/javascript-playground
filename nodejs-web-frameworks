3) Socket.io
Socket.io is a Node.js server framework for building real-time web applications. 
Being a Javascript library, it allows event-driven, bidirectional communication between web clients and server. 
Socket.io works as a client-side library running in the browser and as a server-side library for node.js. 
The framework allows real-time concurrency for document collaboration and data exchange. 
Moreover, its key features also include asynchronous input/ output (I/O) processing, 
binary streaming, instant messaging (‘Hello World’ chat application) and more.

Simple Chat Example
// Setup basic express server
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var server = require('http').createServer(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(server);
var redis = require('socket.io-redis');
var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
var serverName = process.env.NAME || 'Unknown';
io.adapter(redis({ host: 'redis', port: 6379 }));

server.listen(port, function () {
  console.log('Server listening at port %d', port);
  console.log('Hello, I\'m %s, how can I help?', serverName);
});

// Routing
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
// Chatroom
var numUsers = 0;
io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.emit('my-name-is', serverName);

  var addedUser = false;

  // when the client emits 'new message', this listens and executes
  socket.on('new message', function (data) {
    // we tell the client to execute 'new message'
    socket.broadcast.emit('new message', {
      username: socket.username,
      message: data
    });
  });

  // when the client emits 'add user', this listens and executes
  socket.on('add user', function (username) {
    if (addedUser) return;

    // we store the username in the socket session for this client
    socket.username = username;
    ++numUsers;
    addedUser = true;
    socket.emit('login', {
      numUsers: numUsers
    });
    // echo globally (all clients) that a person has connected
    socket.broadcast.emit('user joined', {
      username: socket.username,
      numUsers: numUsers
    });
  });

  // when the client emits 'typing', we broadcast it to others
  socket.on('typing', function () {
    socket.broadcast.emit('typing', {
      username: socket.username
    });
  });

  // when the client emits 'stop typing', we broadcast it to others
  socket.on('stop typing', function () {
    socket.broadcast.emit('stop typing', {
      username: socket.username
    });
  });

  // when the user disconnects.. perform this
  socket.on('disconnect', function () {
    if (addedUser) {
      --numUsers;

      // echo globally that this client has left
      socket.broadcast.emit('user left', {
        username: socket.username,
        numUsers: numUsers
      });
    }
  });
});


4) Mojito.
Mojito is a JavaScript framework based on Yahoo! Cocktails, a mobile application development platform introduced by Yahoo! Developer Network. JavaScript is the only programming language which is used for Yahoo! Cocktails Platform. Since client and server components are both written in JavaScript, Mojito can run on both the client side (browser) and the server (Node.js).
Mojito is a model-view controller (MVC) framework offering a gamut of features, such as
    Convenient data fetching.
    Local development environment and tools (Yahoo! independent stack).
    Integrated unit testing.
    Library for simplifying internationalization & localization.

5) Meteor
Meteor is an open-source, model-view controller (MVC) framework for building websites and web/mobile applications. 
The framework supports OS X, Windows, and Linux. 
It allows writing both client and server parts of an application in JavaScript. 
Meteor’s inbuilt set of pre-written, self-contained modules makes writing application codes. 
Moreover, its reactive programming model allows creating applications using lesser JavaScript code. 
Besides, Meteor is a powerful framework for building real-time applications. Popular applications built using Meteor are Respondly 
(a team collaboration app), Blonk (Job search mobile App) and more.

6) Derby
Derby is a model-view controller (MVC) JavaScript framework for both client-side and server-side. 
It is ideal for creating real-time mobile and web applications. 
Derby’s Racer, a real-time data synchronization engine for Node.js allows multi-site, real-time concurrency and data synchronization across clients and servers. 
By leveraging ShareJS, Racer optimizes conflict resolution algorithm and allows real-time editing within an application. 
Moreover, server rendering is one such feature of Derby that allows fast page loads, search engine support and HTML templates to render in the browser or on the server.

var fs = require('fs')
  , path = require('path')
  , http = require('http')
  , request = require('request')
  , TMP_FILE_PATH = path.join(path.sep, 'tmp', 'foo')
;

// write a temporary file:
fs.writeFileSync(TMP_FILE_PATH, 'foo bar baz quk\n');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  console.log('the server is receiving data!\n');
  req
    .on('end', res.end.bind(res))
    .pipe(process.stdout)
  ;
}).listen(3000).unref();

fs.createReadStream(TMP_FILE_PATH)
  .pipe(request.post('http://127.0.0.1:3000'))
;
12) BROWSERIFY- browser-side require() the node.js way  -  npm install -g browserify

var bar = require('../lib/bar.js');
var gamma = require('gamma');
var elem = document.getElementById('result');
var x = foo(100) + bar('baz');
elem.textContent = gamma(x);
module.exports = function (n) { return n * 111 }
$ browserify main.js > bundle.js
